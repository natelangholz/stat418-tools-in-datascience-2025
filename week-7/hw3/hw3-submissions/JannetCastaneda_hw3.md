## Description

This project builds and deploys a machine learning model as a REST API to predict miles per gallon (MPG) using the `mtcars` dataset. The model was trained in Python, wrapped in a Flask app, containerized with Docker, and deployed to Google Cloud Run.

The repo includes the trained model (`model.pkl`), Flask API (`app.py`), Docker configuration (`Dockerfile`), and `requirements.txt`. The app was tested both locally and via a deployed URL.
