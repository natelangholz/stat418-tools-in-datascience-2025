### Homework3 Work flow
* [x] Create a standalone github repo called `Mtcars Flask Api`. Use the mtcars.csv dataset to create a predictive linear model using `mpg` as a response and any (or all) other remaining variables as predictors using Python in a Docker container. 

* [x] With the predictive model create a flask API (first locally) that is functional using a Docker container, push the image to DockerHub, and then deploy to Google Cloud Run. Someone else should be able to stumble across your repo, clone it, and reproduce.

* [x] This github repo should contain a README explaining what is included in the repo and what is being done.

* [x] There should also be directions (possibly in another README in another directory) on how to standup your API. Provide an example input and output (as curl command), so that if I run, calling the API, I will get the same results when I call your deployed model.
